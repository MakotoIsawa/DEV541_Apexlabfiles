/**
 * This trigger implements Universal Containers requirements for programmatic sharing,
 * allowing hiring managers permissions on position objects depending on the stage of the 
 * position.
 * Other sharing rules, such as org-wide sharing permissions based on object stage, are
 * set declaratively.

/** 
 * When a Position record is modified, make sure the sharing rules on the record match 
 * the status fields:
 *   If Status/sub-status = open/approved
 *		- Hiring Manager = Edit
 *		- All others in organization = Read
 *	 Else
 *		- Hiring Manager = Read
 *		- All others in organization = No Access
 * NOTE: Because the Hiring Manager may have been changed on an update, we need to make sure
 *  that any sharing rules for the old Hiring Manager are removed.
